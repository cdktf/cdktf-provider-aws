All the code in this repository is auto-generated using [cdktf-provider-project](https://github.com/cdktf/cdktf-provider-project) and [cdktf-repository-manager](https://github.com/cdktf/cdktf-repository-manager) from the source [Terraform provider](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws). If there are problems, they should be addressed in one of those 3 repositories, not here, as any changes here will just get overwritten the next time there is an update upstream. Please open a new issue or PR in one of those repos. In the meantime, I'll auto-close this. Thanks!"
